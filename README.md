# Shady Fixes
Temp-fixes for Black Marketeers ("shadyguys") in X4 Foundations, until EgoSoft releases a bugfix for them.

Install into the game's extension folder, not the user document extension folder.

## Three Points:
As outlined in the relevant Bug Report: https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?p=5238903
- Include Terran Stimulants as an illegal ware to check
- Exclude tradestations from getting shadyguys
- Ensure correct spawning of shadyguys when DLCs are enabled

That's all.
